Credit card project proposes the development of ML model to predict the potential candidate for approval of credit card.
This will be helpful for banks by reducing risk, optimizing resources and identifying valuable customer. It provides banks to gain a competitive edge, manage risk effectively, and cultivate valuable customer relationship. This project delivers a powerful tool to achieve these goals and contribute to a more inclusive and efficient financial system.
1. Formulate Initial Hypothesis:

Start by exploring any available information about credit card approval factors (e.g., financial reports, industry studies). Based on this, propose a hypothesis concerning the relationship between specific features and the target variable (approval/denial). For example:

Hypothesis 1: Male applicants will get more approval than female
Hypothesis 2: Applicants with higher incomes are more likely to be approved for credit cards.
Hypothesis 3: Logistic Regression is going to predict credit card approval better than any other model

2. Explore Your Data:

Before diving into models, understand your data characteristics:
Data size: Large datasets allow for complex models, while smaller ones might necessitate simpler approaches.
Feature types: Categorical, numerical, text, etc., influence suitable models and feature engineering techniques.
Missing values: Missing data handling methods impact analysis and model performance.

3. Select Relevant Models:

Consider several factors when choosing models:
Data characteristics: Align models with your data type and complexity.
Interpretability needs: If understanding decisions is crucial, opt for simpler models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
Desired outcome: Prioritize accuracy, fairness, or explainability based on your project goals.
Here are some potential models to consider:
Logistic Regression: Simple, interpretable, suitable for smaller datasets or linear relationships.
Random Forest: Flexible, robust to noise, handles non-linear relationships.
XGBoost: Highly accurate, handles diverse features, requires careful tuning.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Powerful for high-dimensional data, less interpretable.

4. Perform Initial Analysis:

Before full model training, consider:
Feature engineering: Create new features to capture relevant information using techniques like one-hot encoding or feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between features and the target variable using histograms, scatterplots, etc.
Train-Validation-Test Split: Divide your data into training, validation (hyperparameter tuning), and testing sets to ensure generalizable results.

5. Train and Evaluate Multiple Models:
Train each chosen model on the training set, tune hyperparameters on the validation set, and evaluate final performance on the unseen testing set using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

6. Compare and Justify:

Compare model performance metrics and select the best based on:
Performance: Choose the model with the best metrics aligned with your project goals.
Interpretability: If understanding decisions is critical, prioritize models like Logistic Regression.
Ethical considerations: Ensure your chosen model avoids biases and complies with fair lending regulations.
